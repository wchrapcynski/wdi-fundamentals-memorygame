# wdi-fundamentals-memorygame

I believe I ended up pulling off the bonuses for this project and then some. Instead of the alert dialog pop up, I added a message section to the page to display various game messages. I also added the reset button as well as displaying how many matches the player has received. The only real thing that's left to do with this game to truly make it functional is to randomly set the cards when the board is set up.
