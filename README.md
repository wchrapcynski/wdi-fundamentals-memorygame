# wdi-fundamentals-memorygame

I believe I ended up pulling off the bonuses for this project and then some. Instead of the alert dialog pop up, I added a message section to the page to display various game messages. I also added the reset button as well as displaying how many matches the player has received. Last, I found a shuffle algorithm that works really well for providing some randomness when the board is set up.
